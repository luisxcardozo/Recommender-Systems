# OPTIMIZATION OF RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR CPU IN TENSORFLOW

## GOAL
This tutorial will introduce you to CPU performance optimizations for recommendation systems and provide performance improvements by:

- Means to optimize Tensorflow* to run faster on CPU;
- Ways to eliminate technology driven bottlenecks with neural Collaborative Filtering;
- Optimization of Wide and Deep.
